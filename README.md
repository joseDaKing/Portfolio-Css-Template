# Portfolio-website

Git was not used in this website

I took inspiration from [pinterst](https://www.pinterest.se/pin/578079302144509348/) for design.

Visit the [website](https://josedaking.github.io/Portfolio-website/).

In this website i used a modified form of (smacss)[https://smacss.com/] css architecture and [bem](http://getbem.com/introduction/) naming convention.
